fitnesseteststore
=================

Java package developed to parse and store fitnesse tests in sqlite in order to track tests 
coverage, e.g. my company uses application ids to organize specific products and product features. 
I develop tests and add those product/feature application ids to the appropriate tests in the database. 
That provides a quick way to determine code coverage, total number of tests per product/feature, etc...
